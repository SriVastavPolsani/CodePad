# CodePad

CodePad is a live output generator web application built from scratch which lets you write code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and immediately generate the output in a window at the extreme right of the screen. The output takes no time to be generated and changes as you edit code. This application was written in JavaScript and JQuery.
